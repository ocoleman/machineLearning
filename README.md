## How to Run

In order to run the <b>Tasks.ipynb</b> notebook it is highly recommended you first install Anaconda which can be gotten <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. This distribution of Python will provide you with all the required libraries including <a href="https://jupyter.org/install.html" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebook</a>.

Once installed, simply clone this repository with git then navigate to the location of <b>Tasks.ipynb</b>. Once there open a command terminal and type "jupyter notebook" and hit enter. A local server should launch, and a browser window will take you to the notebook dashboard. From there you should see the Tasks notebook, if your browser does not open immediately the console should provide you with a link that you can paste in the URL bar of your browser.
