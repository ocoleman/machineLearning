    "#### Task 3 - Standard Deviation: STDEV.P vs STDEV.S\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The main difference between the two excel functions is that STDEV.P assumes the data it is passed represents an entire population, whereas the STDEV.S function expects to be given a sample of a population.[1] Unless you have a whole population as your data, using STDEV.S will generally provide a more accurate estimate of the standard deviation. This is because the mean of a sample is often not representative of the mean of an entire population. STDEV.S addresses this bias through employment of Bessel's correction (the len(x)-1 observed in the numpy calculation below).[2] In practice, this adjustment slightly enlarges the value we get for STDEV.S which it turns out is actually a fairly accurate estimate for the standard deviation of a total population.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The below code segment demonstrates the better accuracy of the STDEV.S function over STDEV.P. The data simulated is based on the real average height of US males and the accompanying standard deviation.[3] *x* is assigned an array of 100 height values in a normal distribution centered at 178cm (1.78), with a standard distribution of 8cm (0.08). A STDEV.P and STDEV.S estimation of the standard deviation are then gotten as *p* and *s* respectively. This process is then repeated 1000 times, at each iteration *p* and *s* are compared with the one closer to the actual standard deviation receiving a point. The final output shows that the STDEV.S calculation consistently scores higher in estimating the standard deviation over the 1000 iterations.\n",
